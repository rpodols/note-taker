# Note Taker - Challenge 11

## Description
This project is the eleventh challenge of the coding bootcamp.

User Story: As a small business owner, I want to be able to write and save notes so that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete.

Starting from minimal starter code, this challenge required writing additional code to do the following:
* Given a note-taking application, when I open the note taker, then I am presented with a landing page and a link to a notes page.
* When I click on the link to the notes page, then I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note's text in the right-hand column.
* When I enter a new note title and the note's text, then a save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page.
* When I click on the Save icon, then the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with other existing notes.
* When I click on an existing note in the list in th eleft-hand column, then that note appears in the right-hand column.
* When I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page, then I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note's text in the right-hand column.
